# SoccerVideos

I created this project so that I could practice on how to refresh a list in swiftUI because apple didn't add the feature to it, which I think it's important to have. 
This is still in the works and I am still figuring out ways to make it better.

For now the app just pulls soccer videos from a 3rd api, which is sent in json, and then you either click on the image or txt and it will take you to the web.
